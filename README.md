Mummy's Tiffin is a platform that connects homemaker mothers with students living away from home, ensuring they receive fresh, home-cooked meals. Day-scholar students carry extra tiffins prepared by their mothers and exchange them with hostel students for a reasonable fee. This initiative benefits students by providing nutritious meals and allows homemakers to earn extra income. Our vision is to expand with a mobile app, secure payments, and a rating system to enhance quality and reliability. Join us in bringing a taste of home to every student!
