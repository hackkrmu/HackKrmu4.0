A Summarized Desciption of our Project:
LumiBin is an innovative, AI-driven waste management solution designed to promote environmental sustainability through advanced technology. We have integrated the LumiBin AI model, leveraging Ollama's LLaVA for precise waste detection while seamlessly integrating "PyTorch", "OpenCV", and "Roboflow datasets" to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.

Our intuitively designed, highly accessible front-end ensures a seamless user experience, allowing individuals to effortlessly scan waste materials using their camera. Built with "React" for the front-end and powered by a "Node.js" and "TensorFlow"-based backend, the system accurately detects plastic waste—such as plastic bottles—in real time. Users are encouraged to either dispose of the waste in designated bins or mark its location, which is then recorded and relayed to NGOs for future cleanup initiatives.

To further incentivize participation, our system rewards users with points, which can be redeemed for exciting discount coupons. By combining AI-powered detection with an engaging reward system, LumiBin fosters a cleaner, greener future while integrating cutting-edge computer vision and web technologies for impactful, real-world change.
