**Neo-Card (MVP)**, developed by Coding Crusaders, is transforming the traditional school ID into a smart, secure, and convenient NFC-enabled solution. We address the limitations of smart devices and UPI access in schools by providing a digital ID capable of payments, attendance tracking, and more.

**🏆 Problem:**  Schools face challenges with secure payments, efficient attendance, and limited access control, often restricting smart devices and UPI.

**💡 Solution:** Neo-Card provides a unified NFC-based system, replacing traditional IDs with a smart, digital alternative.

**🚀 MVP Focus:**  This Minimum Viable Product (MVP) showcases the core front-end design and user interface.  Backend integration and full NFC functionality are planned for future development.

## Key Features (MVP)

*   ✅ Digital ID Card Display: Clear and accessible display of student information.
*   🎨 Customizable Card Designs:  Branding and personalization options for a unique school identity.
*   📱 Simulated NFC Interaction (Demo): Demonstrates the intended NFC interaction (actual NFC requires backend/hardware).
*   ✨ User-Friendly Interface:  Intuitive and easy-to-use experience for students of all ages.

## Future Impact

Neo-Card aims to revolutionize the school experience:

*   💰 NFC-Based Payments: Seamless and secure in-campus transactions, reducing reliance on cash.
*   ⏱️ Automated Attendance:  Efficient check-in/check-out, saving time and improving accuracy.
*   🔒 Secure Access Control:  Restricted access to authorized areas, enhancing campus safety.
*   👪 Parental Controls:  Empower parents to manage spending and track transactions.
*   ☁️ Scalable Backend:  Robust backend for data management, security, and scalability across schools.
